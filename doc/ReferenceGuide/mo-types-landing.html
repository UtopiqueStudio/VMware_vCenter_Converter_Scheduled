<h1>Managed Object Types Overview</h1>

<p>
Strictly speaking, managed objects are objects that are cataloged. Managed objects might 
consist exclusively of data objects, but basic data types might be among their 
properties. Managed objects are used to represent and administer entities in your 
environment. 

<p>
Managed objects are often used as parameters that are passed to or returned by methods. 
In those cases, a reference to the actual managed object is being passed back and forth. 
For the sake of simplicity, this document always refers to managed objects rather than 
managed object references. The objects themselves are never passed or returned.

<p>
Managed objects might include:

<ul>
    <li>Objects of which this object is a property.</li>
    <li>The parent object that this object extends.</li>
    <li>The child objects that extend this object.</li>
    <li>Description of purpose and usage.</li>
    <li>Properties.</li>
    <li>Methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After connecting to the server system, the client application must then obtain a reference to the <a href="converter.ServiceInstance.html">ServiceInstance</a> managed object.

<p>
All managed objects are listed in the pane to the left of this page. Click a name to see 
more information. You can also enter part of a managed object name in the Quick Index to 
find an entry.
