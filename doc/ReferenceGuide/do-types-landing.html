<h1>Data Object Types Overview</h1>

<p>
Data objects store information. Data objects are often used by managed objects to store 
information.

<p>
Data objects are typically composed of other data objects, references to managed 
objects, faults, or other basic data types. 

<p>
Data objects can be created, managed, and destroyed either directly by API calls or as a 
result of working with a managed object that has a data object as one of its properties.

<p>
Data objects might include:

<ul>
    <li>Objects of which this is a property.</li>
    <li>The parent object that this object extends.</li>
    <li>The child objects that extend this object.</li>
    <li>Description of purpose and usage.</li>
    <li>Properties.</li>
    <li>Methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All data objects are listed in the frame at the left of this page. Click a name to see 
more information. You can also enter part of a data object name in the Quick Index to 
find an entry.
